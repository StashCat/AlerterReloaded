PlugProtect
===============

###### A successor to the popular old and now-abandoned Alerter protection plugin

PlugProtect is aimed to be a successor to the old and popular protection plugin Alerter, which got abandoned by the developer a few years ago. It's pretty straight-forward, easy to use and useful.
