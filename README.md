WARNING: Source not yet updated to the initial release (v1.0b) version.
======
Code still references the plugin as AlerterReloaded, which it no longer is. Code is also very outdated, probably what I began coding from. Update to the repo is coming when I'm back from vacation.


PlugProtect
===============

###### A successor to the popular old and now-abandoned Alerter protection plugin

PlugProtect is aimed to be a successor to the old and popular protection plugin Alerter, which got abandoned by the developer a few years ago. It's pretty straight-forward, easy to use and useful.
